      <p>Life as we know it is an amazingly fascinating mystery. The sequence of events from cradle to grave can never be taken for granted, notwithstanding that we are all here to fulfill our purpose.</p>
      <p>Pastor Sophia Martin is the eldest of nine children for her mom and dad. She was born in Kingston Jamaica and later migrated to her current home in Canada. Life was not always easy. She recalls many days of not having enough to eat, nor the resources required to attend school, but she knew that God has something great in store for her. In October of 1993, she heard the Lord calling her name and decided to yield to the call of Christ. Since then, she has never once looked back.</p>
      <p>Sophia is a mighty woman of God who tries her best at all times to walk in full obedience to the will of God, knowing that she has only made it thus far through grace and mercy, she does not take her role in the kingdom lightly. She is the mother of a beautiful daughter Peteann, who she talks about happily as her pride and joy.</p>
      <p>She is a past student of the Jamaica Open Bible Institute (JOBI) who completed her studies at the Jamaica Theological Seminary (JTS), where she pursued a theological and counselling degree. She also possesses a Diploma in Secretarial Studies as well as a Diploma in Biblical  Studies. Although she has migrated, her passion for learning and achievement has not dwindled. She has earned a Diploma from Canadian Christian Ministries Theological Seminary in November 2013 and also currently pursuing further studies and will be awarded her Doctoral Degree this August 2016.</p>
      <p>In her ten years of being overseas, God has been so good to her and what an awesome journey of faith, perseverance and blessings it has been. A Canadian Citizen, Marriage Officer licensed by Ministry of Government Services in Canada and in March 2015, was appointed as a Commissioner of Oath in Quebec and all of Canada and now to add to the list she is also an author.</p>
      <p>This first book is one that she hopes will inspire others to fight the good fight of faith and press on amidst trials and temptations. Satan the architect of fear and doubt seeks to plague the minds of believers causing us to believe that God is not coming through for us. These distressing emotions sometimes cause us to lose faith and become bombarded with confusion, but be reminded that the grand picture has only one designer or painter and that is God Almighty and all will be revealed in his time.</p>
      <p>Reverend Martin firmly believes that there is power in the name of Jesus and that the transformational power of God can break every chain setting all captives free.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;">As she writes, it is her sincere hope that you are empowered and remember</p>
      <p>"I don’t know how my story will end, but nowhere in it will you read, that I ever gave up …" If she was to choose a character in the bible to liken her story to it would have to be that of Daniel and the 3 Hebrew Boys they went through the fire that was seen as a symbol of destruction but instead God used it to prove Himself and bring them out as pure gold as painful and initially frightening process but how beautiful was the final results.</p>
      <p>As she proceeds to write her second book, she continues to encourage the body of Christ to wait on Christ. She will seek to educate all through sharing her experiences in her second book entitled: The Other Side of the Story.</p>
      <p>One thing is sure after all the hardships and struggles, she does not look or smell like what she has been through GLORY TO GOD.</p>
